Our application, BusyGator, provides various materials to help SFSU students, staff, and faculty
find everything they are looking for on campus all online. BusyGator is an e-commerce
application that allows students, staff, and faculty to buy different items, from school materials to
gym equipment, as well as list items for others to buy. The BusyGator has numerous
functionalities and services. The main service the application will provide is allowing SFSU
students, staff and faculty to post and / or buy textbooks, sports gear, research devices, and much
more all online. The application has search options and categories to look for more specific
items, and a sign up / sign in option to confirm users are SFSU students or faculty. BusyGator
gives SFSU an opportunity to help their community by managing their resources within the
application. The unique aspect of BusyGator is that all of the features and services in buying and
selling material will be in one place and in one press of a button, where anyone can easily follow.
