BusyGator is an e-commerce application that allows students, staff, and faculty to buy various commodities—from school materials to
gym equipment—as well as create listings for others to buy. 

The main service the application provides is allowing SFSU students, staff, and faculty to post and/or buy textbooks, sports gear, research devices, and much
more all online. The application makes makes finding what you want a breeze through the use of a highly responsive search and categories to help you compare options and find just the perfect product for you. Additionally, a secure authentication system is implemented to ensure that all users are either SFSU students or faculty, and that all user data is sufficiently encrypted.
