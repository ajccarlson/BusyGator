        semester, Spring 2022, earning a bachelor degree in Computer Science. I was inspired to pursue Computer Science since it was my mom’s 
        dream to go to college and learn computer science. I am very happy to be following her dream. High school also influenced my major choice 
        as I was able to take a class introducing computer programming. I am most interested in software development and design, which I plan to 
        take as a career path after college. In my free time, I love to swim, draw, read, play video games, and listen to music.`,

    fullName: 'Samantha Saxton-Getty',
    desc: `My name is Samantha Saxton-Getty and I am currently attending San Francisco State University (SFSU) working to complete my Bachelors 
        of Science Degree in Computer Science. This Spring 2022 is my final semester and I will be graduating at the end of May, early June, with a 
        3.75+ overall GPA. I am most interested in database engineering as last semester I completed an upper division course, “Introduction to 
        Database Systems” where I created my own databases and I have previously manipulated data from an already existing database at my former 
        employer. Alternatively, I am currently taking an “Application Development for Mobile Devices” upper division course this Spring and I am 
        interested in developing this skill further as well. I am ultimately looking to gain better industry knowledge and experience overall and 
        from the perspective of databases to better prepare myself for life after graduation.
        On a personal level, some of my hobbies include, digital art, video games, and spoiling my dog, Bernard, or Bernie. I enjoy hanging out 
        with my friends, playing video games such as League of Legends, Final Fantasy, etc. with them and supporting each other through college.

        learning computer. I am very grateful to the friends that I made during the four year in the college. They are all friendly and help me. 
        I have always been interested in computers and web development. This is the reason why I chose this major. I hoped to make achievements in 
        this field.
